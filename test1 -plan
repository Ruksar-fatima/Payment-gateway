Test Plan – Payment Gateway Functionality

1. Introduction
The purpose of this Test Plan is to define the testing strategy and scope for the Payment Gateway functionality of the e-commerce application. The goal is to ensure that all payment methods work securely, reliably, and efficiently under various scenarios.

2. Scope
This test plan covers:
Functional testing of payment workflows.
Security validation of sensitive data handling.
Performance testing under load.
Integration testing between e-commerce site and payment gateway.
Negative testing for invalid inputs and error handling.

Out of scope:
Backend settlement between banks.
Third-party banking application testing.


3. Objectives
Verify smooth navigation to payment gateway after order placement.
Validate payments through Cards, UPI, Net Banking, and Wallets.
Ensure data security (no sensitive info stored, HTTPS enforced).
Measure system performance under heavy load.
Validate proper integration between order system and payment gateway.
Ensure correct handling of failed, cancelled, or incomplete transactions.


4. Test Strategy
Functional Testing: Validate end-to-end payment flows.
Security Testing: Ensure encryption, HTTPS, and OTP/PIN handling.
Performance Testing: Validate high-load scenarios and response times.
Integration Testing: Verify database updates and confirmation notifications.
Negative Testing: Ensure system stability with invalid inputs and interruptions.


5. Entry & Exit Criteria
Entry Criteria:
Application build deployed.
Test environment ready.
Payment gateway sandbox credentials available.

Exit Criteria:
All critical and high-severity defects resolved.
Test cases executed with ≥95% pass rate.
No open security vulnerabilities.


6. Risks
Dependency on third-party payment gateway uptime.
Delay in receiving OTP/SMS from banks.
Load testing limitations in staging environment.
